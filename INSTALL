pychebfun - Python Chebyshev Functions
======================================

Basic Install
-------------

In your terminal of choice, navigate to this directory and type::


    $ python setup.py install


That's it! Now you can import `pychebfun` into your Python scripts from any
directory you like.



Custom Install
--------------

If you


    -- have a local / special directory for Python modules

    -- are a developer and don't want to muck up your system Python library


then you can specify which directory to install `pychebfun` like so::


    $ python setup.py install --home=<dir>


where `<dir>` is a directory of your choice. For example, if `<dir>` is your
home directory, `$HOME`, then `pychebfun` will install into `$HOME/lib/python`.
